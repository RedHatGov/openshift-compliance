<h2>Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The Security Concept of Operations (CONOPS) details, at various levels of abstraction, a
deployment of Red Hat&#8217;s OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) deployed on Amazon Web Services (AWS).  The NIST <em>Definition of Cloud Computing</em> (<a class="reference external" href="http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-145.pdf">NIST 800-145</a>) succinctly describes different cloud service models and the attributes of a cloud platform.  The architecture described herein follows the definitions found in the NIST 800-145.  For example, Red Hat&#8217;s OCP is a Platform as a Service (PaaS) under NIST 800-145.  Similarly, AWS is an Infrastrucutre as a Service (IaaS) per the NIST definition.</p>
<div class="section" id="security-standards">
<h3>Security Standards<a class="headerlink" href="#security-standards" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The Fedral Information Security Modernization Act (<a class="reference external" href="http://csrc.nist.gov/drivers/documents/FISMA-final.pdf">FISMA</a>), originally enacted in 2002, directs United States Federal Agencies to develop and implement programs to implement information and information systems security.  This reference architecture aims to describe an OCP deployment on AWS as FISMA high: high confidentiality, high integrity, high availability.</p>
<p>In order to demonstrate FISMA high, this architecture is traced to <a class="reference external" href="https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/800-53/home">NIST 800-53</a> <em>Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information Systems and Organizations</em>.  The NIST 800-53 provides a catalog of controls accross multiple categories.  Many controls relate to organizational processes.  These controls will be mapped as appropriate.  The controls that are technical in nature are addressed by this architecture.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="architecture">
<h2>Architecture<a class="headerlink" href="#architecture" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This architecture is divided into architectural views loosely mapped to the NIST 800-145 <em>Definition of Cloud Computing</em>.  The nature of cloud computing affords the adoption of a Landlord/Tenant model.  This model allows the Landlord to take responsibility for a set of controls under NIST 800-53, relieving the tenant of the need to address those controls.  The following table lists lists the relationship of Landlord to Tenant in this reference architecture.</p>
<table border="1" class="docutils">

<p>As stated prviously, the IaaS in this architecture is AWS.  Red Hat&#8217;s OCP is the PaaS.  Tenant applications are deployed in containers, managed by OCP.</p>

<h3>Infrastructure View<a class="headerlink" href="#infrastructure-view" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>

<h4>Network Architecture<a class="headerlink" href="#network-architecture" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>The <strong>Staging Subnet</strong> provides an isolated area for platform administrators to apply regular patches and test configuration changes before applying these to the operations cluster.  One cluster of OCP is deployed in this VPC.</p>
<p>The <strong>Operations Subnet</strong> contains a single deployment of OpenShift where tenants will deploy applications.  OCP Nodes will be labled and functionally grouped to support development, test, and production deployments of an application.  This is described in detail in the <em>Platform View</em>.</p>
<p>The <strong>Management Subnet</strong> contains the Trusted Container Repository as well as the Package Repository.  A route table allows the <strong>Managent Subnet</strong> to communicate to the <strong>Staging Subnet</strong>, <strong>Operations Subnet</strong>.  The <strong>Staging Subnet</strong> and <strong>Operations Subnet</strong> are not permitted to communicate with each other. A VPC peering connection allows the <strong>Management Subnet</strong> in the <strong>Red Hat VPC</strong> to communicate with any <strong>Dedicated VPC&#8217;s</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Dedicated VPC&#8217;s</strong> are VPC&#8217;s that are deployed to support specific isolation needs of a particular tenant.  These may be created and destroyed per organizational needs.</p>
<p>The <strong>bastion host</strong> allows OCP Administrators and only OCP Administrators the ability to access the underlying hosts in each VPC.</p>
<p><strong>Application Developers</strong> interact with OCP via a command line interface (CLI) and web user interface (WebUI).  An application router, internal to OCP, handles application traffic.  Therefore certain ports in a security group must be exposed on the <strong>Red Hat VPC</strong> to allow ths traffic.  The same is true of any <strong>Dedicated VPC&#8217;s</strong>.  The following table details this information.</p>

<p>In order to achieve network traffic isolation between containers owned by different tenants running on the same node, the traffic must be encapsulated.  This capability is provided by OpenVSwitch which encapsulates the OSI L2 traffic from the containers in the L3 traffic between the nodes.  The packets are then tagged by an 24 bit value known as a VXLan Network Identifier (VNID).  A VNID corresponds to a project space in OCP and is transparent to both the <strong>Application Developer</strong> and <strong>Application User</strong>.  In order to utilize this option the <em>redhat/openshift-ovs-multitenant</em> must be selected during the installation.</p>
<p>The L3 traffic between nodes is sent as UDP packets to port 4789.</p>

<h4>Platform Security - Container Security<a class="headerlink" href="#platform-security-container-security" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Container security occurs at multiple levels.  At the platform level, OCP applies <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.3/architecture/additional_concepts/authorization.html#security-context-constraints">security context constraints</a> (SCC&#8217;s) to manage what a container can and cannot do.  OCP provides a number of SCC&#8217;s out of the box.  The default SCC is highly restrictive to unprivileged containers.</p>
<p>Unprivileged containers are containers deployed in a tenant application.  Specific action is required on the part of the <strong>Cluster Administrator</strong> to allow an <strong>Application Developer</strong> the ability to deploy a container with escallated privileges.</p>
<p>A notable attribute of SCC&#8217;s is the user ID enforcement.  When a container executes, the entry process runs in the container as a specified user ID.  The <em>restricted</em> SCC forces the container to be run as a very high UID.  This prevents a container from being deployed where the internal user ID is set to 0 (root).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="storage-architecture">
<h4>Storage Architecture<a class="headerlink" href="#storage-architecture" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Managing storage is a distinct problem from managing compute resources. OpenShift Container Platform leverages the Kubernetes persistent volume (PV) framework to allow administrators to provision persistent storage for a cluster. Using persistent volume claims (PVCs), developers can request PV resources without having specific knowledge of the underlying storage infrastructure.</p>
<p>In this reference architecture, storage services are provided through a managed storage tier, implemented by Red Hat Gluster Storage (Gluster).  Gluster provides a fault-tolerant and highly available network storage resource, efficiently rationed to tenant applications as PVs.  Since the storage interface to developers is managed by the Kubernetes PVC resource, the details of the underlying storage implementation are abstracted.</p>
<p>PVCs are specific to a project and are created and used by developers as a means to use a PV. PV resources on their own are not scoped to any single project; they can be shared across the entire OpenShift Container Platform cluster and claimed from any project. After a PV has been bound to a PVC, however, that PV cannot then be bound to additional PVCs. This has the effect of scoping a bound PV to a single namespace (that of the binding project).</p>
<p>The Gluster storage services are provided through a dedicated cluster of AWS instances within the scope of the platform VPC.  Administrators allocate storage resources, creating a pool of available PVs in standard sizes, and monitor the capacity of the underlying storage resources.  As PVs are released, administrators ensure the deletion and reclamation of storage resources, returning capacity to the pool of available PVs.</p>

<h4>Platform Security - Storage Security<a class="headerlink" href="#platform-security-storage-security" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Gluster complies with data protection requirements through secure configuration of the storage resources and transport protocols.  At rest, data is protected by LUKS encryption of the of the AWS EBS devices.  This ensures that access to EBS volumes or snapshots by unauthorized mechanisms are unable to extract any usable information from the storage tier.  Configuration of LUKS encryption in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 is configured according to the <a class="reference external" href="https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/7/html/Security_Guide/sec-Encryption.html">Encryption chapter of the RHEL 7 Security Guide</a>.</p>

<h4>Application Security - Sensitive Configuration Data<a class="headerlink" href="#application-security-sensitive-configuration-data" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>There is often a need to provide sensitive data for the proper configuration of the application or service component.  For instance, it may be necessary to provide encryption keys, passwords, configuration files, private source repository credentials, and other data considered sensitive.  This data often varies between environments, such as database passwords or SSL server certificates.  Secrets provide a mechanism to decouple sensitive content from the pods that use it, removing the necessity of storing this data on the filesystem or within the container image itself.  This mechanism promotes best practices for abstracting environment-specific configuration data away from the build process, as well as provides an encrypted storage mechanism.

<p>A container in the context of an information system is an operating system level virtualization method, provided by kernel constructs, for isolating prcesses using a single kernel.</p>
<p>Due to the value of containers to the information technology field, the definition for both the container image specification and runtime are managed by a community of interested parties: <a class="reference external" href="https://www.opencontainers.org/">Open Container Initiative</a> (OCI).  The technical definition is divided into an Image Specification (image-spec) and Runtime Specification (runtime-spec).</p>

<p><strong>Platform Administrators</strong> are responsible for two specific container processes in the OCP cluster.  The first is an integrated container registry.  The second is an application traffic HAProxy router, running in a container.  While these nominally operate without intervention, their continued operation falls under the responsibility of the <strong>Platform Administrators</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Application Developers</strong> do not necessarily need to be aware of the container construct in OCP.  An <strong>Application Developer</strong> can deploy a containerized application inside OCP simply by providing OCP a source code repository.  At this point OCP automatically builds the source into and deploys a containerized application.</p>

<h4>Container Filesystem<a class="headerlink" href="#container-filesystem" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>A single container as it exists on the host&#8217;s filesystem is actually a multi-layer filesystem: UnionFS.  Each container image consists of a <em>Kernel</em> library layer, <em>bootfs</em>, and <em>Base Image</em>.  Additional layers may contain application libraries and binaries.  Once this container image is built, it is immutable.  This has implications:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Any patches to a lower layer of the container (e.g. the base image) require the container to be rebuild from that level up.</li>
<li>Without an externally mounted persistent storage share, any data written to the container&#8217;s file system is lost when that container is destroyed.</li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The following graphic presents a simplified view of a layered container image.</p>
<p><img alt="Container Image" src="_images/ContainerLayers.png" /></p>
<p>External storage can be provided to the container and mounted as a file system in the container for data persistence.  The platform layer abstracts the <em>Persistent Volume</em> from the container.  The container has no knowledge of the nature of the underlying storage share; only that it has a file system to which it can write.</p>
