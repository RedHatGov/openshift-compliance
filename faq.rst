Frequently Asked Questions

Is this guide complete?
-----------------------
No. As of version 1.0 beta it is still under construction. There are several
efforts under way to accredit OpenShift at FISMA High. During that process
this guide will be updated, probably a lot.

Has OpenShift been accredited anywhere?
---------------------------------------
Yes, at variants of FISMA Moderate in several places in the US Department of
Defense.

How can I help?
---------------
If you'd like to get involved, fork the `project`_ and send us pull requests.

If you're not sure where to start, or if you've found a mistake or problem,
take a look at the project `Issues`_ page for this version (`1.0beta`_).

X is wrong, what's up?
----------------------
Found a mistake? Great! Open an `Issue`_.

Who can I talk to about this?
-----------------------------
`Jason Callaway`_ would be happy to talk your ear off about this. Or you could
talk to your Red Hat account team.
